# Features

## Public List

All players can add and view positions in the public list.

This is useful so that you can, for example, mark the first village so that EVERYONE can find it.

You can exchange positions between public and private lists

## Private List

The Private List is good if you want to mark positions for yourself so that you can find each other later. E.g. the entrance to the mine.

You can exchange positions between public and private lists

## BackUps

With the backups you can back up all of the plugin's data so that it doesn't go missing. With /pbackup you can open the backup overview where you can load, create and delete backups.
